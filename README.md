# CECS-328-Algorithm-Projects
These are several school projects created to showcase knowledge of algorithms. Algorithms are made from scratch from understanding of the topic.
Projects can be found in Projects/src file.

Project 1:
  Compares a sorting of an input array with choice of 5 different levels of sorting algorithms.
  
Project 2: 
  Program accepts an input of string from user represented as an arithmetic expression. 
  The program parses executes a tree walk. 
  The answer is returned.
  
EcProject: 
  Performs quicksort and radix sort operations.
  Executes 5 different operations of choice:
  
    1. Find K-bit Binary representation of number.
    
    2. Find Decimal Number of Binary input.
    
    3. Calculate Running Time of RadixSort and QuickSort.
    
    4. Generate Random Array and Find running time of RadixSort and QuickSort.
    
    5. Quit.
